# html5_mmo
## Game Maker html5 export module with javascript extension bundled for websockets, server side nodejs using 39js wrapper.

only works with supplied node.exe, add to your path environment variable if you wish or use the batch file.

I had intended on making a full mmo with this but the 39js.dll javascript wrapper<br/>
(and game maker extension written as javascript extending game maker for html5 export module) 
<br/>was incomplete and needs a full rewrite with an updated node. 

all of the different versions of game maker, extensions, socketio(version 0.8.4), node and coupled with outdated web connections, makes for a very glitch experience. But the proof of concept is there.
